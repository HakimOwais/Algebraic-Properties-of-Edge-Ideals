# Algebraic Properties of Edge Ideals

This thesis explores the interplay between commutative algebra and combinatorics through the study of edge idealsâ€”monomial ideals generated by edges of a graph. It was submitted in partial fulfillment of the Integrated BSc-MSc in Mathematics degree at the Central University of Kashmir, India, under the guidance of Dr. Shahnawaz Ahmad Rather.

## Overview

The document develops a range of algebraic and combinatorial techniques, including:

- **Graded Rings and Modules**
  - Introduction to graded structures and monomial orderings.
  - Study of monomial ideals and their connections with simplicial complexes.

- **Combinatorial Commutative Algebra**
  - Construction and analysis of minimal free resolutions.
  - Computation of graded Betti numbers, Hilbert functions, and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.
  - Methods for extracting algebraic invariants from combinatorial data.

- **Simplicial Homology and Stanley-Reisner Theory**
  - Basics of simplicial complexes and the formulation of the Stanley-Reisner ideal.
  - Use of homological tools and Alexander duality to understand the underlying combinatorial structure.

## Key Themes

- **Edge Ideals:**  
  Investigation of ideals associated with graphs, focusing on their algebraic properties and free resolutions.

- **Graded Structures:**  
  Emphasis on graded modules and rings to manage the multi-graded nature of the problems and to capture the complexity of edge ideals.

- **Free Resolutions and Invariants:**  
  Detailed study of minimal free resolutions, including the computation of graded Betti numbers and analysis of regularity measures.

- **Combinatorial Methods:**  
  Bridging algebra and combinatorics via simplicial complexes, Stanley-Reisner theory, and homological techniques.

## Purpose and Applications

The thesis aims to:
- Uncover structural insights about edge ideals.
- Develop algebraic tools that address combinatorial challenges in graph theory.
- Provide a foundation for further research in combinatorial commutative algebra and algebraic graph theory.
